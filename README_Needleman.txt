README

NOTE: ALL CAPS IS NOT SCREAMING!!!

I COULDN'T UPLOAD ONE FILE. SO I'VE UPLOADED THIS INSTEAD. YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD A FOLDER. I'VE CODED 4 SEPARATE FILES.
THE FOLDER HAS ALL THE STUFF THAT SETS UP MY EXPERIMENT. MY CODE JUST WON'T WORK ON ITS OWN.

Where you can find it: https://github.com/ChrisMatthewCyril/Needleman/tree/Version3.0
Beware, choose Version3.0. It's the most recent one.

Instructions on how to run Chris Matthew's Final "Exam" code.

Navigate: Needleman --> venv --> Core --> Decipher.py.

Run decipher.py to get going.

Important:
You will need all the files I've given you. It'll ask you to specify the following:

1. The full filepath where you'd like the report.
2. The name of the report file.
3. The full filepath of the BMAL1 fasta file.
4. The full filepath of the CYCLE fasta file.
5. The full filepath of the location of DataBank, the folder where I've carefully named sample fasta files.

Below are example calls for the above that resulted in perfect execution:

1. "/Users/chrismatthewcyril/Documents/GitHub/Needleman/venv/"
2. "1"
3. "/venv/BMAL_CYC_FILES/BMAL.fasta"
4. "/venv/BMAL_CYC_FILES/CYCLE.fasta"
5. "/Users/chrismatthewcyril/Documents/GitHub/Needleman/venv/DataBank/"

THIS WAS DONE ON MAC OS! WINDOWS IS DIFFERENT: C:\Users\XXXXX\YYYYYY\ZZZZZZZ\
DON'T FORGET THE FINAL SLASH!
